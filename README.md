HGT
===

The **Shuttle Radar Topography Mission** (SRTM) [(Wikipedia article)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttle_Radar_Topography_Mission) is a NASA mission conducted in 2000 to obtain elevation data for most of the world. It is the current dataset of choice for digital elevation model data (DEM) since it has a fairly high resolution (about 90 meters at the equator, and <30 meters in the U.S.), has near-global coverage (from 56° S to 60° N), and is released into the public domain.
SRTM data provides topography information, relief shading, and elevation profiles for the given terrain.

Format
---

The data is divided into one degree square tiles. The outermost rows and columns of each tile overlap with the corresponding rows and columns of adjacent tiles.

The tiles are distributed as zip files containing **.hgt** files. The .hgt files have a very simple format: a series of 16-bit integers giving the height of each cell in meters. SRTM3 tiles have 144201 integers representing a 1201x1201 grid.

Fractals
===
A **fractal** [(Wikipedia article)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal) is a mathematical set that typically displays self-similar patterns. Fractals may be exactly the same at every scale, or, as illustrated in Figure 1, they may be nearly the same at different scales. The concept of fractal extends beyond self-similarity and includes the idea of a detailed pattern repeating itself.
